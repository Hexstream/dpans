The files in this directory are simply the PDF versions of the compressed DVI files in the "dvi" directory.

The files were simply extracted and then converted from DVI to PDF using dvipdf.

This was done by Jean-Philippe Paradis on 5 july 2019 and the resulting files are released into the public domain.
